We are looking for the following properties: 
The code should be correct. Show that the application correctly matches all substrings according to your stated lazy or greedy match policy and passes your provided test examples. 
The code should be optimized for parsing a potentially large input text file. 
The front end should be intuitive and useful (doesn't have to be complex). 
Write a short blurb on how you would improve the look, feel, and performance of this application and how you've validated that the application behaves as designed. 
Remember that you may integrate or use any framework of choice, but the regular expression parser must be from scratch.
