Since this is my first Python app, the install process isn't as clean as I'd like it to be. There are some extra commands needed to install Python dependencies. All frontend dependencies are handled by `npm install`. To run the app after cloning the repo, go to the project directory and run:

### `pip install Flask`
### `pip install Flask-Cors`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
